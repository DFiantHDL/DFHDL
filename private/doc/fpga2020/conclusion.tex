\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we proposed new dataflow hardware description constructs that abstract away registers and wires to achieve device-agnostic and timing-agnostic designs. We also presented DFiant, a dataflow HDL, and exposed its advantageous semantics and constructs when compared to RTL HDLs. DFiant provides a seamless concurrent programming approach, and yet it still facilitates a versatile compositional and hierarchical expressiveness. 
Future work may explore expanding the dataflow language constructs to simplify resource sharing by merging and splitting dataflow paths (e.g., using the same multiplier for different paths) as well as upsampling (e.g., duplicate each token) downsampling (e.g., drop every third token) a dataflow path.
