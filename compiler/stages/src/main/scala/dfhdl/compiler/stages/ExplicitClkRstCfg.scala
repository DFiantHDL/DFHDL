/** This stage converts a derived clock-reset configuration of RT designs/domains to
  * explicit/related configurations. The rules are (when a derived configuration is discovered):
  *   1. For a design, we first check its contents for Clk/Rst "usage", and if they are in use, the
  *      explicit configuration is taken from its owner, if such exists. If its owner is an ED
  *      domain or the design is top-level, the elaboration options' default configuration is used.
  *      If no Clk/Rst "usage" is detected, then the explicit configuration is set to None. Clk/Rst
  *      "usage" is indicated by any of the following:
  *      - a register declaration (for rst, a non-bubble init must be used to trigger rst usage)
  *      - a register alias (for rst, a non-bubble init must be used to trigger rst usage)
  *      - an internal design that has explicit Clk/Rst configuration
  *      - an explicit Clk/Rst declaration by the user
  *      - a top design default configuration's inclusion policy is set to `AlwaysAtTop`
  *   1. For a domain with non-Clk/Rst input port members, the explicit configuration is taken from
  *      its input source. The input source is determined by searching for a source that is
  *      registered and get its register's owner domain, and consequently its configuration. An
  *      earlier elaboration check should prevent any ambiguity from the source. One such possible
  *      ambiguity is having two domains that provide inputs and outputs to each other and both are
  *      declared with derived configuration. In this case, we get a circular derived configuration
  *      dependency, which should yield an error during elaboration.
  *   1. For a domain with no input port members, the domain is considered to be a related domain of
  *      the domain's owner and the configuration is set accordingly.
  *   1. When deriving a no-Rst configuration from a with-Rst configuration `cfg`, the derived
  *      config is set as `cfg.norst`, with the name mangling `${cfg.name}.norst`. This name
  *      mangling is special-cased in various stages and compiler logic and used to indicated that
  *      both domain configurations are derived from one another.
