# Meta Hardware Description


<!-- All DFHDL declarations, types, and values are essentially Scala values. Therefore, you can write a Scala program (aka DFHDL meta-programming) to generate hardware, including ports.

```scala
class ManyPorts(portNum: Int) extends DFDesign:
  val i = UInt(8) <> IN
  val o = UInt(8) <> OUT
``` -->
