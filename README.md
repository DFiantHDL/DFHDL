Welcome to the DFiant hardware description language (DFHDL) repository! 

DFHDL is a dataflow HDL and is embedded as a library in the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/). DFiant enables timing-agnostic and device-agnostic hardware description by using dataflow firing rules as logical constructs, coupled with modern software language features (e.g., inheritance, polymorphism, pattern matching) and classic HDL features (e.g., bit-accuracy, input/output ports). Additionally, DFHDL integrates two additional levels of hardware description abstractions: register-transfer (RT), which is equivalent to languages like Chisel and Amaranth; and event-driven (ED), which is equivalent to Verilog and VHDL.
