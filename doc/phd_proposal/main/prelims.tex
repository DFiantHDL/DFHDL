\label{chap:prelims}

A preliminaries chapter is not necessary, but it may be a good idea to use it for presenting your theoretical/mathematical framework in a more detailed and technical way than the introduction, and to perhaps establish some basic lemmata/observations common to multiple chapters of your thesis.
