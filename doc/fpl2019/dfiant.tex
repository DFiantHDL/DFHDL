\section{The DFiant Language Overview}
\label{sec:dfiant}
DFiant is a Scala library and thus possesses various rich type safe language constructs. DFiant also incorporates unique language semantics that enable dataflow-based hardware description. Throughout this section we elaborate on these constructs and semantics via our running example, a four-by-four moving average (MA4) unit. The MA4 has four 16-bit integer input channels and is required to output the average of all channels, while each channel is averaged by a four-sample moving window continuously. The complete MA4 DFiant implementation and its equivalent dataflow graph are available in \fig{fig:MADFiant} and ~\ref{fig:MADraw}, respectively. \fig{fig:MAVHDL} presents a subset of the DFiant-generated VHDL (2008) code derived from lines 11-12 in \fig{fig:MADFiant}.

\subsection{Hello DFiant world!}
The MA4 DFiant code in \fig{fig:MADFiant} demonstrates the basics of any DFiant compilation program: it imports the \code{DFiant} library (line 1), creates the top-level design by extending the \code{DFDesign} library trait (lines 3-21), and creates a runnable application that instantiates the top design trait and compiles it into a VHDL file (lines 29-32). 

The MA4 design is fairly straightforward. Lines 4-8 generate the signed dataflow ports and include a \code{0} value initialization (see Section~\ref{sec:state_constructs}). 
Lines 10-14 define the function \code{ma} that generates a single four-sample moving average, while lines 15-16 define the function \code{avg2} that generates a two-input average unit. Finally, lines 18-20 compose \code{avg2} and \code{ma} to generate the entire MA4 functionality and assign it to the output port \code{o}. We elaborate on the unique DFiant constructs and semantics in the next sections.


\subsection{Dataflow Semantics}
DFiant code is expressed in a sequential manner yet employs an asynchronous dataflow programming model to enable an intuitive concurrent hardware description. For this purpose, DFiant applies the following rules:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item \textit{Concurrency and Execution Order}\quad Concurrency is implicit and the data scheduling order, or \textit{token-flow}, is set by the \textit{data dependency}. DFiant schedules all independent dataflow expressions concurrently, while dependent operations are synthesized into a guarded FIFO-styled pipeline. The MA4 dataflow graph in \fig{fig:MADraw} demonstrates the concurrent paths constructed from the dataflow dependency. 
	\item \textit{Basic Operations}\quad Each application of an arithmetic/logic operator is translated into the appropriate hardware construction and applies a dataflow \emph{join} on their arguments. The arguments require a valid token for consumption to produce a new token generated from the operations. For example, \code{+} in \code{avg2} joins \code{src1} and \code{src2} and requires a token from both to produce the token \code{src1 + src2}.
%	\item \textit{Conditional Branches}\quad DFiant has `ifdf` and `casedf` conditional constructs. All inputs to the
	\item \textit{Path Divergence}\quad Diverging paths are implicitly \emph{forked}, so token production is possible if all target nodes are ready to consume the token. For example, \code{acc} result in \code{ma} is forked into a division operation and the state feedback.	It is impossible to consume an invalid token and once a token is consumed it is invalidated.
	\item \textit{Constants}\quad Any Scala primitive value is considered as a constant when applied as an argument to a dataflow operation. For example, the value \code{2} in \code{avg2} is a primitive \code{Int} and is considered a constant in the division operation. Semantically, a constant is an infinite token generator that produces a new token with the same initial value each time the token is consumed.
	\item \textit{Pruning}\quad Unused nodes always consume tokens and are discarded during compilation. 
\end{itemize} 



\subsection{State Constructs and Semantics}
\label{sec:state_constructs}
In contrary to RTL languages, DFiant does not directly expose register and wire constructs. Instead, DFiant assumes every dataflow variable is a stream and provides constructs to initialize the token history via the \code{.init} construct, reuse tokens via the \code{.prev} construct, and update the state via the \code{:=} construct. Lines 11-12 in \fig{fig:MADFiant} along with their compiled VHDL representation in \fig{fig:MAVHDL} demonstrate the state semantics as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item \textit{Initialization}\quad The \code{.init} construct is accompanied by one or more token values and only sets the initial state history. For example, line 11 constructs a dataflow variable and initializes all of its history zero value tokens. 
	\item \textit{History Access}\quad The \code{.prev} construct reuses the previous state token. The very first "reused" token is the one set via \code{.init}. It is also possible to call \code{.prev(step)} with a step number argument to reuse older stream values. For example, in line 12 we reuse a \code{src} token from four steps ago. If the \code{src} token stream is "$1,2,3,4,...$" with a $0$ initialization, then the \code{src.prev(4)} token stream is "$0,0,0,0,1,2,3,...$".
	\item \textit{Stall Bubbles}\quad Invoking \code{.prev} on an uninitialized dataflow variable generates a stall bubble. Stall bubbles are consumed and produced like any other token, yet a basic operation with a stall bubble token must produce a stall bubble token. Additionally, stall bubbles do not affect a feedback state. The backend compiler is responsible to generate the additional logic required for existing design stalls. 
	\item \textit{State Update Scheduling}\quad The new updated token is pushed into a dataflow stream by using the \code{:=} assignment construct. There can be more then one assignment to same variable, however only the last assignment updates the state and occurs when all dependent dataflow firing rules are satisfied. This rule is similar to signal update semantics in VHDL processes.
	\item \textit{Default Self-Generation}\quad Any dataflow \code{a} variable has an implicit self-assignment \code{a := a.prev} that comes immediately after the variable construction. This creates an equivalent reference between \code{a} and \code{a.prev} which leads to a more intuitive programming.
	For example, in line 12 we used \code{acc - ...} and not \code{acc.prev - ...}, since both expressions are equivalent.
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{0.5ex}

\fig{fig:MAVHDL} emphasizes the advantages of DFiant state constructs over RTL registers and wires.
One advantage is that the DFiant code resembles its RTL counterparts, but is also very concise since state elements are automatically constructed when a stream history is accessed. Another advantage is portability, because state elements are not registers and any type of state component is applicable. Our first synchronous backend indeed maps state elements to registers, but even an asynchronous backend can compile the same code and apply the Muller C-element\cite{muller1957theory} as a state element. 


\subsection{Automatic Pipelining, Path-Balancing and Flow-Control}

The dataflow abstraction enables designers to describe hardware without explicitly pipelining the design. The DFiant backend compiler automatically pipelines the design and places registers to split long combinational paths. The compiler has a propagation delay (PD) estimation database that can be tailored for any target device and technology. With this information and a target clock constraint the compiler tags the dataflow graph with the additional pipe stages required before producing the RTL code. One possible tagging is depicted in \fig{fig:MADraw}, in which two pipe stages were added between the large operations. Depending on the availability of DSP blocks in the target device, it is also possible to break the basic operations to multiple cycles by instantiating the proper vendor IP (e.g., a long multiplication operation should require several cycles). All of these target-specific adaptations are done without designer intervention and thus make any DFiant design highly portable.

To maintain design correctness the compiler adds path-balancing registers when pipeline registers are added and different-latency paths converge. Since these two features are separate, we can allow designers to explicitly place pipe stages in critical junctions should our PD estimation fail. The \code{.pipe} construct adds a pipe stage at a specific node and the compiler will balance the rest of the converging paths. While both \code{.pipe} and \code{.prev} constructs appear similar, the \code{.prev} construct does affect the path-balancing mechanism. For example, \code{x - x.prev} create a derivation circuit while \code{x - x.pipe} will result in a constant zero since path-balancing applied at the subtraction input arguments results in a \code{x.pipe - x.pipe} operation.

The asynchronous nature of DFiant means the compiler can adapt the design to any FIFO ready-valid signaling for automatic flow-control. For example, the MA4 RTL interface can have ready-valid signaling to each of its input and output ports to allow backpressure. To achieve this manually in RTL is extremely error-prone, while the DFiant generated RTL code stays true to the original dataflow description, and therefore, correct.

In Section~\ref{sec:motivation} we discussed the problem when attempting to pipeline a feedback state. The \code{ma} function creates the feedback state referenced via the \code{acc} variable. The \code{ma} blowout in \fig{fig:MADraw} exposes this problem by having a circular feedback that updates the \code{acc} state. This feedback cannot be pipelined as-is because path-balancing will never be able to satisfy the balancing rule due to circular path dependency. It is only possible to increase the clock rate in feedback circuitry by applying multi-cycle or speculative logic (e.g., a RISC-V processor core contains several feedback junctions like the PC update and therefore has single-clock, multi-cycle and speculation-based pipelined implementations). 


\subsection{Structural Composition and Generation}
DFiant expands traditional structural composition capabilities by utilizing Scala's object oriented features such as inheritance and polymorphism, as well as finite loops and recursive composition. The hierarchical compositions provide the scope and dependencies for the dataflow variables. The hierarchy itself is transparent to the dataflow graph, as if the entire design is flattened, inlined, and unrolled. Therefore, hierarchies in DFiant are synthesizable, highly reusable, and do not affect the design performance (may affect compilation time). 

%\subsection{IO Ports}
%\label{sec:io_ports}
%The class \textit{Box} from Table~\ref{tbl:Box} can also be coded as demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:IOBox}. The annotation \code{DFVar $<>$ Dir} controls \textit{DFVar}'s access by encapsulating the variable with the dataflow port class, \code{DFPort}: an \code{IN} port can only be read (immutable), while an \code{OUT} port can only be modified (unreadable). DFiant has implicit conversions in place that selectively converts between \code{DFPort} and \code{DFAny} instances, without breaking mutability rules and type safety. The port annotations match the capabilities of traditional HDLs, and are noticeably absent from HLS languages such as C++. 

\subsection{Bit-Accurate Operations and Type Inference}
DFiant supports various basic dataflow types such as \code{DFBool}, \code{DFBits}, \code{DFUInt}, and \code{DFSInt}.
All DFiant's dataflow types are bit-accurate and structurally static, with their bit-width set upon construction (e.g., \code{DFBits[5]} is a 5-bit vector). Operations between dataflow variables produce a bit-accurate result with the proper type inference. For example, an addition between an unsigned 5-bit variable (\code{DFUInt[5]}) and a signed 10-bit variable (\code{DFSInt[10]}) produces an adder that can be implicitly converted to a 10-bit signed variable, if carry is not required, or an 11-bit signed variable by explicitly invoking \code{.wc} from the addition. DFiant also allows operations between dataflow types and their corresponding Scala numeric types, by treating the Scala numeric types as constants (e.g., addition between \code{DFSInt} and \code{Int} variables). 

%\subsection{Mutability}
%\label{sec:mutability}
%DFiant supports dataflow variables mutability via the \code{:=} operator. Do not confuse with Scala-level mutability which is enabled by using \code{var} instead of \code{val}. Each dataflow class has two variations: an immutable class, which inherits from \code{DFAny\textbf{Val}} and a mutable class, which inherits from \code{DFAny\textbf{Var}} and accepts \code{:=}. The difference between the types enforces an immutable right-hand-side (RHS), where required, and a mutable variable creation. Consider, for instance, the DFiant implementation of \code{g} in Table \ref{tbl:StateExDefImpl}: \code{a} is immutable because it is a RHS addition between the dataflow variable \code{i} and a literal value \code{5}. Contrarily, \code{c} is mutable, since it is a dataflow variable constructor (\code{.init} constructs a new initialized variable, while preserving the mutability trait). 

%Fig.~\ref{fig:Inherit} demonstrates a dual class definition for every type  (immutable and mutable). The naming convention helps to reason about the mutability. For example, \code{DFBits} and \code{DFBits.Var} are immutable and mutable classes, respectively. Constructing a new variable via \code{DFBits} (e.g, \code{val a = DFBits[5]}) returns the mutable \code{DFBits.Var[5]}. Usually, we either receive or return an immutable type, hence we do not require annotating a type with its mutable variation. In cases where we want to return a mutable type, we annotate it as an output port (see Section~\ref{sec:io_ports}).

%DFiant's code safety is enforced by maintaining the 'DF-mutability' trait while aliasing (accepting the ':=' operator). This means that an alias of a \textbf{Var}, is still a \textbf{Var}, and can be assigned, while an alias of a \textbf{Val} cannot. This concept is illustrated in ???, and further explained in ???:




%\subsection{Bit Aliasing and Casting}
%Aliasing in DFiant enables referencing a part of a dataflow variable, by invoking \code{.bits(hiIdx, loIdx)}, which creates a bits vector alias that references the original variable at the given index parameters. Every change of a dataflow variable affects its alias and vice versa (similar to VHDL's signal aliasing). Since this function also casts the variable as \code{DFBits}, this feature is used as a raw-data cast between different dataflow types. Aliasing of an alias is also possible, while maintaining relative bits indexing. Aliasing preserves the mutability trait: an alias of an immutable variable is immutable, while an alias of a mutable variable is mutable. 


%Fig.~\ref{fig:Aliasing} demonstrates aliasing code and its effect on the contents of a dataflow variable (\code{bits128}). Each line code does as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Constructs a new 128-bit vector, \code{bits128}, and clears it.
%  \item Creates a new alias, \code{alias64}, which references the most significant 64 bits of \code{bits128}. Since \code{bits128} is a \code{DFBits} variable, there is no need to invoke \code{.bits()}, and we can apply the required indexes directly.
%  \item Creates a new alias, \code{alias32}, which references the least significant 32 bits of \code{alias64}, which reference bits 64 to 95 of \code{bits128}.
%  \item Constructs a new double precision floating point dataflow variable, \code{dbl}, and initialize its value as \code{1.0} (hexadecimal value of \code{0x3FF00...0}).
%  \item Modifies the least significant byte of \code{dbl}.
%  \item Sets the most significant bit of \code{bits128}.
%  \item Assigns \code{dbl} to the least significant 64 bits of \code{bits128} through casting. All the bits of \code{dbl} are selected because \code{.bits()} is invoked without index parameters.
%  \item Modifies a byte of \code{bits128}.
%
