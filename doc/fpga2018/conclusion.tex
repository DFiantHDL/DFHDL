\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we presented our extension of DFiant, a dataflow HDL, and exposed its advantageous semantics, when compared to modern RTLs and C++-based HLS tools, such as VHDL and Vivado HLS, respectively. DFiant provides a seamless concurrent programming approach, and yet it still facilitates a versatile compositional and hierarchical expressiveness. We evaluated DFiant in two computational-heavy case studies, and demonstrated its competing performance alongside its code simplification. 

%Although we established its many benefits, DFiant is still missing a few milestones before it becomes a worthy replacement for the traditional HDLs. 
So far,  we demonstrated how DFiant covers static one-to-one token transfer functions. Notwithstanding, functionality may require upsampling (e.g., duplicate each token), downsampling (e.g., drop every third token), token arrival time dependency (e.g., priority round-robin arbiter), or token value dependency (e.g., filter out odd-valued tokens). Future work may explore expanding control over token generation and consumption.
